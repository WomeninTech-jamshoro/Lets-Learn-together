## Steps to add your contribution

**1. Fork**

- Forking will create a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository.

- Go to [https://github.com/WomeninTech-jamshoro/Lets-Learn-together](https://github.com/WomeninTech-jamshoro/Lets-Learn-together)

- See on top right corner fork the repository from there.

**2. Clone**

- Clone is a copy of repository on your local instead of on a website's server where you edit file in your preffered editor.

![Fork](/assets/images/clone.png "Clone")

command for git clone : `$ git clone [URL]`
*[URL]-url that was copied in clipboard*

**3. Create your Branch** 
 
`$ git checkout -b <branch-name>`

**4. Make some contribution**

You can add or edit any file.

**5. Add Changes and Commit Changes**

- `$ git add <file-name>` or `$ git add . `

- `git commit -m "Add my-commit" `

**6. Push changes to GitHub**

`git push origin <branch-name>`
 
## Submit your changes for review

Once you push your code to GitHub, now it's time to create your `pull request`, you will go to the repository click on `compare and pull request` and submit the pull request.
